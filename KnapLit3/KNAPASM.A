    Version History
    2017-08-29 First release
    2017-09-07 Adapted for algorithm selector
               Other experimental variations
    2021-05-26 Moved parameter positions for standarization, ie array size previous to
                its address, exception is targetSum which is half minus one the size
               Change disposition of thisArray non interleaving Sums and Results for
                up to 40% faster processing

    parameters:
    eax: ADDRESS(asmknapsack)   - This function - not used here - it is only for the
                                  automatic algorithm selector
    ebx: targetSum              - Payment Amount (integer). It is also the elements count less 1
                                  of the first dimension of thisArray, the second
                                  dimension is always 2. Total elements (targetsum+1)*2.
    ecx: ADDRESS(thisArray)     - Working array for the algorithm preinitialized -1 on each cell
                                  (except the first one which has to arrive with 0) "AmountsMatrix"
    edx: nRows                  - Elements count of invoiceArray
    [(new)ebp]+8:
         ADDRESS(invoicesArray) - Array of Integers with amount values (with 2 decimals
                                  they need to be multiplyed by 100 and rounded)

    local variables:
    ebp+8 ADDRESS(invoicesArray) (being there as 5th parameter on Clarion calling convention)
    ebp-4 i (initialized with 0)
    ebp-8 nRows                  (pushed there to free edx)

    registers:
    eax: temporal comparations and swappings
    ebx: targetSum
    ecx: ADDRESS(thisArray)
    edx: j
    esi: nextsum
    edi: precomputed pointer to nextsum cell

    Note: Registers where choosen intentionally for the massively used data while
    stack memory for the less used ones. Also the algorithm was adapted in a
    logically equivalent way to reduce memory access.

(* an experimental test usign an extra register to hold the invoicesArray[i] start value of the
   internal loop, thus avoiding substracting j from nextsum to get it back to its original value
   on each cycle. An extra register, an extra mov and avoiding a sub introduced an improvement
   aproximatelly 0,6% 28 sec in a 4716 seconds test (30 repetitions of 158sec aproximatelly each).
   Problem was there seems no more accesible registers on this assembler implementation (no r8d xmm8..)
   so test were done with ebp register, but discarded as the improvement was not so significant
   and using that register it that way is not standard and causes debugger to loose the call stack trace
   when the algorithm is running *)
